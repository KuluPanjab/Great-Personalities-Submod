The entire country is mourning the loss of a great leader and beloved figure. It is with sadness that we report his passing after a short tenure of just 31 days.

EVTNAME1010118;The Death of Zachary Taylor;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010118;This is a sad time for the American nation. President Zachary Taylor was found unconscious, and after several days battling an illness, he sadly passed away. Taylor's death came as a shock to the country, having been the 12th president of the United States and widely respected for his leadership during the Mexican War. With Taylor's death, his vice president, Millard Fillmore, is expected to become the new president of the United States. Fillmore, formerly a member of the Whig Party, is now responsible for continuing to lead the nation through this uncertain time. Fillmore's rise as president is viewed with skepticism by some, as he lacks the same military experience that Taylor did. However, he is known for his devotion to the Constitution and his leadership skills, which is a source of hope for many Americans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1010137;The news of the death of Horace Greeley, one of the main candidates for the presidency of the United States, shook the country. Greeley had been the Liberal Democrat Party's nominee for this year's election, and his campaign focused on promoting national reconciliation after the Civil War. With Greeley's death, the Liberal Democratic Party is faced with a difficult decision. With the presidential election still in progress, the Democratic party finally chose Charles Francis Adams Sr. to replace Greeley and face incumbent President Ulysses S. Grant, who is seeking re-election, in the presidential race.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
