term_of_office;Term of Office;;;;;;;;;;;;;
term_of_office_desc;In a democracy, the term of a leader is defined by regular elections, which usually occur every four or five years. In a monarchy, the term of a leader may vary depending on local laws and traditions, but it is typically lifelong or until the monarch chooses to abdicate. In a dictatorship, the leader can remain in power for an indefinite period, often without free and fair elections.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
